Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a hotbed of research in data science these days and 
one of the most common applications of NLP is sentiment analysis. From opinion polls to creating
entire marketing strategies, this domain has completely reshaped the way businesses work, which is 
why this is an area every data scientist must be familiar with.
Thousands of text documents can be processed for sentiment
(and other features including named entities, topics, themes, etc.) in seconds, compared to the
hours it would take a team of people to manually complete the same task.
